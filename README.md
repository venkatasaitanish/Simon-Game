# Simon-Game

### Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

A simple memory game with different sounds.

The page displays 4 colored buttons each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device.

At each level a random colored button is triggered and you have to repeat the same pattern by pressing the buttons which are triggered from the staring level to the current level in the same order.

At each level if you succeed to enter the correct pattern, you get a score of 10 times of the level number and immediately moves to the next level.
If you entered wrong the game stops and you can restart the game again.

You can play the game at [Link](https://venkatasaitanish.github.io/Simon-Game/)
